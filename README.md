# Fetch
### A Gradebook app for Pupper/Doggo Trainers!

## Project Summary / Idea
Fetch is an app for Pupper trainers to list and grade dogs.

## User Stories
1) As a user I want to add a dog to the list
2) As a user I want to change the grades for a dog
3) As a user I want to delete a dog after it graduates
4) As a user I want to see a dog’s progress
5) As a user I want to keep track of all the dogs on my watch
